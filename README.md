# Hello, I'm Kassandra :)

I'm a Sr. Project Manager with 7+ years of experience in public health strategy, and I'm currently upskilling to transition to tech.

I'm an AI/LLM-assisted coding nerd, and right now I'm most excited about building agentic AI systems with MCP tools.

I'm slowly building up my portfolio of projects: here is <a href="https://www.whichtechstack.com">Which Tech Stack?</a>, my first attempt at building a web app using AI coding assistants. I built this quiz because I was unclear about which stacks to use for different kinds of projects. Let me know if you find it useful!

While learning, I'm mostly finding ways to use Python and other scripting languages and frameworks to solve my own problems.
